## Overview

The repository includes a variety of training and decoding algorithms to cater to different needs and use-cases for span-based NER.

## Training Algorithms

Here are the different training algorithms that have been implemented:

1. **Standard Span-Based NER with Local Objective**: This is the baseline algorithm for training the span-based NER model.
  
2. **Global Span Selection**: An implementation based on the model from Zaratiana et al., 2022a.

3. **Filtered Semi-Markov CRF**: This algorithm utilizes global span selection but adds label-dependent scoring and transition scores. It is essentially a filtered version of the original semi-CRF algorithm.

## Decoding Algorithms

The implemented decoding algorithms aim to return non-overlapping spans. The following algorithms are available:

1. **Greedy Decoding**: Returns the first best non-overlapping spans.
  
2. **Exact Decoding**: Returns spans with the highest sum of scores.
  
3. **Exhaustive Search**: Utilizes an arbitrary scoring function to return spans with the maximum score.
   - This has been proposed in our [Zaratiana et al., 2022b](https://aclanthology.org/2022.umios-1.1/)


## Configuration Options

To configure the model and decoding algorithm, modify the configuration file (see config/conll.yaml as an example) as described below:

### Model variants
#### Filtered Semi-Markov CRF:
```plaintext
model_type: "fsemicrf"
decoding: "global"
```

#### Global Span Selection:
```plaintext
model_type: "gss"
decoding: "global"
```

#### Standard Model:
```plaintext
model_type: "standard"
decoding: "greedy"
```

### Alternatives
* Options for **decoding** parameter:
```plaintext
- 'global': maximize sum of span scores
- 'global_mean': maximize average of span scores
- 'greedy': greedy span selection
```

* Options for **model_type** parameter:
```plaintext
- 'standard': Standard Span-Based NER loss (span-level NLL)
- 'fsemicrf': Filtered Semi-Markov CRF loss 
- 'gss': Global Span Selection loss
```

In this paper, we describe a novel approach to named entity recognition, in which we output a set of spans (i.e., segmentations) by maximizing a global score. During training, we optimize our model by maximizing the probability of the gold segmentation. During inference, we use dynamic programming to select the best segmentation under a linear time complexity. We prove that our approach outperforms CRF and semi-CRF models for Named Entity Recognition. We will make our code publicly available.",

    abstract = "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in Natural Language Processing with applications in many domains. While the dominant paradigm of NER is sequence labelling, span-based approaches have become very popular in recent times but are less well understood. In this work, we study different aspects of span-based NER, namely the span representation, learning strategy, and decoding algorithms to avoid span overlap. We also propose an exact algorithm that efficiently finds the set of non-overlapping spans that maximizes a global score, given a list of candidate spans. We performed our study on three benchmark NER datasets from different domains. We make our code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/urchade/span-structured-prediction}.",
