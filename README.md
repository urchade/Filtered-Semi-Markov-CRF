## Overview

The repository includes a variety of training and decoding algorithms to cater to different needs and use-cases for span-based NER.

## Training Algorithms

Here are the different training algorithms that have been implemented:

1. **Standard Span-Based NER with Local Objective**: This is the baseline algorithm for training the span-based NER model.
  
2. **Global Span Selection**: An implementation based on the model from Zaratiana et al., 2022.

3. **Filtered Semi-Markov CRF**: This algorithm utilizes global span selection but adds label-dependent scoring and transition scores. It is essentially a filtered version of the original semi-CRF algorithm.
